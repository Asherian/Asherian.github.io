           <h1>Capital Citizen</h1>
           <p> Coming from the metropolitan capital Korinth you've experienced things like nature, at some of the many parks downtown. 
                You've joined the expedition because it sounds like a delightful way to really establish yourself, the bounty 
                for the two year contract is simply to good to pass up. You heard about the journey and applied to be part of the scouting parties so you'd actually
                see this new world, not simply wait to hear about it from someone else while you stay in back in the town. You've always been passionate about
                learning and are known for your ability to ferret out a puzzle when you stumble upon one. You're application to join the scouts was accepted and you've
                been told to report to the Lyessa for your assignment to a team.

        <h1>Terith Nomad</h1>
            <p>
                You're people are an oddity in the empire. While merchants commonly travel between the cities and states few others leave the strong 
                walls of their city. Terith take pride in knowing the paths between cities better then the walled interior. While it feels strange to
                be leaving your clan, the call to leave even those established paths and walk lands unknown is to strong to deny for you. The empire put
                in a request to your clan for a skilled tracker

        <h1>Oppenhert Graduate</h1>
        <p>
            Graduating from the prestigous Oppenhert University you've been brought along to help identify and puzzle out what the scouts bring back to camp.
            At least, that was what the brochure said, but you feel the call to go out in the field, prove yourself and your magic skills

                <h1>Stowaway</h1>
        <p>You tried to apply and get in honestly, but for whatever reason the recruitors were having none of it. Now you've managed to stash yourself upon the
            Lyessa so you can be one of the first to set foot on this new world, figuring once out at sea you'll be safely along. It wasn't so safe you discovered
            when the captain caught on you were with them a week out of port. Only the intervention of the kindly quarter master Lanuka saved you from trying to 
            swim home. He reassured the captain he'd find plenty of work for you while the ship was at sea, and then well, they could always use another scout once
            they'd landed.

                The pantheon of Gorenethen are the Family. The deep mother, Garenit, is the earth and the deep places inside of it. She embraces teh importance
                of stability, the need to have patience and tend your resources. Her dark depths promise respite and rest among the treasures she grows within
                herself. The sky father, Deluta, yearns for knowledge, to see to experience. He came upon the mother and fell in love with her quiet tenacity and strength.
                In courting her he brought her seeds she took into herself and grew the plants and forest. He moves constantly never able to settle, needing to
                see the next horizon. 
                <br>Over time they've had three children, Ralen, first born son of Deluta grew lonely over time and shaped friends from trees
                for himself, naming them the Elves. He shared with them his love of the beauty his parents had created with nature, and insights to the the why
                and how of magic. He shares his father's passion for travel and acquiring knowledge above all else. After time, Gorensa was born to Garenit, and
                much as her brother took after their father she shared with her mother. 
                <br>Gorensa saw the elves as flighty immature creatures, focusing on learning
                but not doing or growing. She shaped her own children to glory in her mother's deep depths with her from the stones in her mother's vaults naming
                her children Dwarves. She taught them the importance fo diligence, of growing communities and building up not simply experiencing. The first cities
                grew within the mountains of the mother, who shared her bounties with these children who so revered her treasures. The siblings grew to love the 
                others children and taught them like their own for centuries. 
                <br>The third child, Zerika was born. Sharing her mother's love of treasure, and her father's zest for life she saw the children her siblings
                had created and aspired to prove herself and have children of her own. She is who created most of the life of Aestria, from the grass and bushes
                she created the animals of the land, but they could not talk. She shaped children from the sand and was delighted in humans, finding them fond of
                her jokes. From mud she created Vedalken, children who shared her zest for life. So she continued, shaping children from all she could find. She 
                did not stay with her children though, and left them to learn as they could from her elder siblings children.
                <br>The children with no gudiance became jealous of the others, and strife came between them. The first wars between men began leading to a
                pain to the gods. A pact was formed that no more children would be shaped by any of them, and that Ralen and Gorensha would share their ways with
                the younger races of Zerika in trade. So was Goreneth founded and named for the goddess who taught them the way of cities and growing together. 
                Ralen taught the younger races of travel and moving swiftly through nature now grown hazardous along with the secrets he'd share with elves so
                long ago of the of magic.
